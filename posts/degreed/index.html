            <h1 id="my-graduation">My graduation</h1>
<p>Almost 2 months ago i was coronated engineer. Why tolk now about that?
I don't know.</p>
<h1 id="feels">Feels</h1>
<p>This is a short post about my impressions of my graduaation cerimony.
It is a bachelor degree, so it is not a big deal on today's standards.</p>
<p>It was a simple cerimony, but it was so difficult to organize all.
I live in a different city for study so my parents had to come here.</p>
<p>But I don't want to talk a lot about personal difficulties of the days before.</p>
<p>So let's talk about my little presentation of the project that I've made.
I had 10 minutes to talk about the realization of an algorithm of machine learning that took me
about 6 months. It was satisfying to talk about my considerations and all the arguments that i've
made to produce the final result.
Basically because I was in front of the people that i love.
It was less satisfying that the teachers haven't made any question(I don't think it was all clear,
but I think that was a time problem).</p>
<p>After that there were the celebrations. The best part of that, again because I was with the people
that I love and had helped me (more in a psychological way that in my studies, because they do
other thinks in life, but you can learn from everyone) during this journey.</p>
<p>The important thing that make me think is that after the cerimony and celebrations it was all as
before. This for me meant only one thing : the journey is more important that the final result.</p>
<p>I look what i was 3 years ago and what I'm now. I'm changed and improved in some things that I was concerned about, at the same time I've not changed some of my habits that I don't like but I'm trying to improve.</p>
<p>Now I start again my journey to go who knows where but I can say I'm more happy than a year ago.</p>
<p>I want to make big things, I hope that i would.</p>
<h1 id="p-s">P.S.</h1>
<p>This post is all a fake.</p>
<p>I only want to flex my dress and my beauty on that day.</p>
