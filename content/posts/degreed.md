# My graduation

Almost 2 months ago i was coronated engineer. Why tolk now about that?
I don't know.

This is a short post about my impressions of my graduaation cerimony.
It is a bachelor degree, so it is not a big deal on today's standards.

It was a simple cerimony, but it was so difficult to organize all.
I live in a different city for study so my parents had to come here.

But I don't want to talk a lot about personal difficulties of the days before.

So let's talk about my little presentation of the project that I've made.
I had 10 minutes to talk about the realization of an algorithm of machine learning that took me
about 6 months. It was satisfying to talk about my considerations and all the arguments that i've
made to produce the final result.
Basically because I was in front of the people that i love.
It was less satisfying that the teachers haven't made any question(I don't think it was all clear,
but I think that was a time problem).

After that there were the celebrations. The best part of that, again because I was with the people
that I love and had helped me (more in a psychological way that in my studies, because they do
other thinks in life, but you can learn from everyone) during this journey.

The important thing that make me think is that after the cerimony and celebrations it was all as
before. This for me meant only one thing : the journey is more important that the final result.

I look what i was 3 years ago and what I'm now. I'm changed and improved in some things that I was concerned about, at the same time I've not changed some of my habits that I don't like but I'm trying to improve.

Now I start again my journey to go who knows where but I can say I'm more happy than a year ago.

I want to make big things, I hope that i would.

# P.S.

This post is all a fake.

I only want to flex my dress and my beauty on that day.
