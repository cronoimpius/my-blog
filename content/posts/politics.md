# Disclaimer
These are my ideas, you can not agree with them, but still i want to write.
For me.

# Intro

For people who aren't from Italy, recently there are been elections (on 25 of September to be precise).
The results were debated all over the word, so maybe some of the people that are reading this already know somethig.

The principal point is that the right coalition won. Not only that, but also the most voted party was *Fratelli d'Italia*, who has been under observation for many years for their notorious link to far right movement (in Italy and Europe), and also for the relationship of <ins>some</ins> of their members with fascist and neo-fascist people/movement.

There is more. Not only the party has been put in discussion, but also the leader: Giorgia Meloni.
She probably (certainly) will be the first woman in Italy to became PM.

This is why some people are mad (especially in left parties and some people in the femminist movement).

It's beautiful to see the contrast between a far right party win electinos and a dream of female emancipation to become true.
Only in Italy XD.

# What I think

What I wrote up is a summary of the situation in my view, but there are some critical points that I want to discuss.

The first is how **bad was the approach of left parties**. They haven't any ideas, ando the only think that they said in the political compaign was how bad would be to have far right to rule the state.

That is unacceptable.
The left parties are delusional.
They are divided, corrupted and they act like they haven't to prove nothing.
They think that people need to vote them because in the other side there is right.
And right equals fascism in Italy.

That said the next point is how people, young people or lefties, react to the news.
I never liked the fact that lefties have to be the ones in the right (XD).

A lot of the people mentioned before offended people who voted for the opponents. That is not fair in a democracy (or whatever Italy is). I think that the vote is the expression of the citizens. I'll respect that even if I don't like it.

I know the stories between Fratelli d'Italia, their leader and people connected with them.
I have hope.
Hope that a extremist party would became a soft one when it has to rule.

The only think that matters to me is not who won, but that it will do the best to tacke this historical epoch.
I'm living after the Covid19 crisis (or for better say in), and in the middle of war of Russia in Ucraine: all ingredients that takes to the crisis of gas, electicity and the consequent recession.

I have hope that Giorgia and the government will improve Italy.

Even if I don't share their ideas.

Another crucial point is that a lot of people where so discouraged about politics and politicians that they didn't event go to vote.

Only 63% of italians have voted. The mininum in italian democracy history.

That should make someone reflect.
But it doesn't.

# Conclusion

I ever have the sansation that we (in Italy) have to be too critical before see something.
This is why we are scared about the future (even me), and try to protect what we have now and preserve it.

The solution that I hope someone will follow in the near future is that we need young people in politics.

It's difficult to have hope in this historical moment, and of that movement.

But it is the only think that we have left...
